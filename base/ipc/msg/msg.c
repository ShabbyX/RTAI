 * 	 it is more efficient and often enough. If you need to pass
 *       arbitrarely long messages see the extended intertask messaging

 *
 * rt_return sends the result @e result to the task @e task. If the task
 * calling rt_rpc is not waiting the answer (i.e. killed or
 * timed out) this return message is silently discarded. The returning task
 * tries to release any previously inheredited priority inherediting the
 * highest priority of any rpcing task still waiting for
 * a return, but only if does not own a resource semaphore. In the latter
 * case it will keep the eighest inheredited priority till it has released
 * the resource ownership and no further message is waiting for a return.
 * That means that in the case priority inheritance is coming only
 * from rpced messages the task will return to its base priority when no
 * further message is queued for a return. Such a scheme automatically
 * sets a dynamic priority ceiling in the case priorities are
 * inheredited both from intertask messaging and resource semaphores
 * ownership.
 *
 * @return On success, task (the pointer to the task that is got the
 * reply) is returned. If the reply message has not been sent, 0 is
 * returned. On other failure, a special value is returned as
 * described below:
 * - @b 0: The reply message was not delivered.
 * - @b 0xFFFF: @e task does not refer to a valid task.
 *
 * @note Since all the messaging functions return a task address,
 * 0xFFFF could seem an inappropriate return value. However on all the
 * CPUs RTAI runs on, 0xFFFF is not an address that can be used by any
 * RTAI task, so it is should be always safe.
