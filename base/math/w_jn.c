 * wrapper jn(int n, double x), yn(int n, double x)
 * floating point Bessel's function of the 1st and 2nd kind
 * of order n
 *          
 * Special cases:
 *	y0(0)=y1(0)=yn(n,0) = -inf with division by zero signal;
 *	y0(-ve)=y1(-ve)=yn(n,-ve) are NaN with invalid signal.
 * Note 2. About jn(n,x), yn(n,x)
 *	For n=0, j0(x) is called,
 *	for n=1, j1(x) is called,
 *	for n<x, forward recursion us used starting
 *	from values of j0(x) and j1(x).
 *	for n>x, a continued fraction approximation to
 *	j(n,x)/j(n-1,x) is evaluated and then backward
 *	recursion is used starting from a supposed value
 *	for j(n,x). The resulting value of j(0,x) is
 *	compared with the actual value to correct the
 *	supposed value of j(n,x).
 *
 *	yn(n,x) is similar in all respects, except
 *	that forward recursion is used for all
 *	values of n>1.
