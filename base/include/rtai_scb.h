 * SCB stand for Shared (memory) Circular Buffer. It is a non blocking
 * implementation for just a single writer (producer) and reader
 * (consumer) and, under such a constraint, it can be a specific
 * substitute for RTAI mailboxes. There are other constraints that
 * must be satisfied, so it cannot be a general substitute for the more
 * flexible RTAI mailboxes. In fact it provides just functions
 * corresponding to RTAI mailboxes non blocking atomic send/receive of
 * messages, i.e. the equivalents of rt_mbx_send_if and
 * rt_mbx_receive_if. Moreover the circular buffer size must be >= to
 * the largest message to be sent/received. At least the double of the
 * largest message to be sent/received is strongly recommended.
 * Thus sending/receiving a message either succeeds of fails. However
 * thanks to the use of shared memory it should be more efficient than
 * mailboxes in atomic exchanges of messages from kernel to user space.
 * So it is a good candidate for supporting drivers development.

/**
 * Allocate and initialize a shared memory circular buffer.
 *
 * @internal
 *
 * rt_scb_init is used to allocate and/or initialize a shared memory circular
 * buffer.
 *
 * @param name is an unsigned long identifier;
 *
 * @param size is the size of the circular buffer.
 *
 * @param suprt is the kernel allocation method to be used, it can be:
 * - USE_VMALLOC, use vmalloc;
 * - USE_GFP_KERNEL, use kmalloc with GFP_KERNEL;
 * - USE_GFP_ATOMIC, use kmalloc with GFP_ATOMIC;
 * - USE_GFP_DMA, use kmalloc with GFP_DMA.
 * - for use in kernel/(multi-threaded)user space only applications the
 *   user can use "suprt" to pass the address of any memory area (s)he has
 *   allocated on her/his own. In such a case the actual buffer should be
 *   greater than the requested size by the amount HDRSIZ at least.
 *
 * Since @a an unsigned long can be a clumsy identifier, services are provided
 * to convert 6 characters identifiers to unsigned long, and vice versa.
 *
 * @see nam2num() and num2nam().
 *
 * It must be remarked that only the very first call does a real allocation,
 * any following call to allocate with the same name, from anywhere, will just
 * increase the usage count and map the circular buffer to the user space, or
 * return the related pointer to the already allocated buffer in kernel/user
 * space.
 * In any case the functions return a pointer to the circular buffer,
 * appropriately mapped to the memory space in use. So if one is really sure
 * that the named circular buffer has been initted already parameters "size"
 * and "suprt" are not used and can be assigned any value.
 *
 * @returns a valid address on succes, you must use it, 0 on failure.
