	help
	This option allows you to select the UP realtime scheduler to
	be interfaced to the RTAI module. This type of scheduler don't
	have to be used on a MP machine.

config RTAI_SCHED_SMP
	bool "Scheduler for SMP machine (kernel tasks only)"
	default n

	help
	This options corresponds to the Multi-Processing realtime
	scheduler. It can use either the 8254 or the local APIC
	timer. Be warned that the APIC based scheduler cannot be used
	for UP, unless you have the local APIC enabled, i.e. an SMP
	machine with just one CPU mounted on the motherboard.  It is a
	fully symmetric scheduler, where at task init all real time
	tasks default to using any available cpu.

config RTAI_SCHED_MUP
	bool "Multi-UP scheduler for SMP machine (kernel tasks only)"
	default n

	help
	Multi-Uniprocessor is a pseudo-SMP implementation where
	several virtual processors are going to be served by a single
	physical CPU. The system is therefore able to support several
	scheduling queues or pseudo-timers.

	RTAI offers an implementation of an MultiUniProcessor (MUP)
	realtime scheduler to be interfaced to the RTAI module. It is
	based on the local APIC timers. It can be profitably used on
	MP machines with just one CPU mounted on the motherboard.

	The advantage of using the MUP scheduler comes mainly from the
	possibility of using mixed timers simultaneously,
	i.e. periodic and oneshot, where periodic timers can be based
	on different periods, and of possibly forcing critical tasks
	on the CPU cache

	All the fuctions of UP and SMP schedulers are available in the
	MUP scheduler, as well as MUP specific functions can be used
	under UP-SMP.

config RTAI_SCHED_LXRT
	bool "LXRT scheduler (kernel and user-space tasks)"
	default y
	help

	LXRT is a user-space interface providing a symmetric API that
	may be used by both real-time RTAI tasks and linux
	processes. The full range of Linux system calls is then
	available and transitions between "soft" real-time and "hard"
	real-time can be performed.

	As far as scheduling is concerned, LXRT requires the use of
	SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy with statically assigned process
	priorities to achieve "soft" real-time performance whilst in
	user-space. Since LXRT provides the faculty to switch an
	application process to real-time, a real-time agent task is
	created and executes the real-time services on behalf of the
	LXRT process. 
	
	The NEWLXRT scheduler unifies U/MP and kernel/user space by
	scheduling Linux tasks/kernel threads natively, along with
	RTAI kernel tasks, all in one. In fact, NEWLXRT brings
	something new: a linux hard real-time application interface
	that is totally based on the scheduling of Linux tasks and
	kernel threads only. The NEWLXRT implementation doesn't need
	any RTAI proper task to be supported.

	RPC means Remote Procedure Call. The NetRPC implementation
	corresponds to a synchronous intertask message passing which
	is the old concept and the basis of microkernels, either
	distributed or not.  Using NetRPC makes from RTAI a
	distributed system, both for kernel and user space
	applications.

	NetRPC depends on the messaging support.

	The NetRPC module will be called rtai_netrpc.o.

	help
	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra
	real-time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls
	can be used both in real-time tasks (within the kernel) and
	Linux processes.
	The module will be called rtai_shm.o.

config RTAI_TRACE
	bool "LTT support"
	default n
	help

	Originally, the Linux Trace Toolkit is a suite of tools
	designed to extract program execution details from the Linux
	operating system and interpret them. Specifically, it enables
	to extract processor utilization and allocation information
	for a certain period of time. It is then possible to perform
	various calculations on this data and dump this in a text
	file. This tool is enhanced by a GTK GUI which allows an easy
	exploitation of those results.  The Linux Trace Toolkit has
	been natively integrated into RTAI modules.

	help

	RTAI already contains some examples hinting at managing
	interrupts in user space, e.g: resumefromintr in lxrt-net_rpc,
	pressa in lxrt, but all of them require installing a proper
	handler in kernel space to wake up a hard real-time
	LXRT/NEWLXRT task.

	The user space interrupt support does the same but adds
	something that permits you to avoid writing anything in kernel
	space.

	The module will be called rtai_usi.o.
