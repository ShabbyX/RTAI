+
+The Adeos nanokernel is based on research and publications made in the
+early '90s on the subject of nanokernels. Our basic method was to
+reverse the approach described in most of the papers on the subject.
+Instead of first building the nanokernel and then building the client
+OSes, we started from a live and known-to-be-functional OS, Linux, and
+inserted a nanokernel beneath it. Starting from Adeos, other client
+OSes can now be put side-by-side with the Linux kernel.
+
+To this end, Adeos enables multiple domains to exist simultaneously on
+the same hardware. None of these domains see each other, but all of
+them see Adeos. A domain is most probably a complete OS, but there is
+no assumption being made regarding the sophistication of what's in
+a domain.
+
+To share the hardware among the different OSes, Adeos implements an
+interrupt pipeline (ipipe). Every OS domain has an entry in the ipipe.
+Each interrupt that comes in the ipipe is passed on to every domain
+in the ipipe. Instead of disabling/enabling interrupts, each domain
+in the pipeline only needs to stall/unstall his pipeline stage. If
+an ipipe stage is stalled, then the interrupts do not progress in the
+ipipe until that stage has been unstalled. Each stage of the ipipe
+can, of course, decide to do a number of things with an interrupt.
+Among other things, it can decide that it's the last recipient of the
+interrupt. In that case, the ipipe does not propagate the interrupt
+to the rest of the domains in the ipipe.
+
+No hosted domain is allowed to use the real hardware cli/sti. But this
+is OK, since the stall/unstall calls achieve the same functionality.
+
+Our approach is based on the following papers (links to these
+papers are provided at the bottom of this message):
+[1] D. Probert, J. Bruno, and M. Karzaorman. "Space: a new approach to
+operating system abstraction." In: International Workshop on Object
+Orientation in Operating Systems, pages 133-137, October 1991.
+[2] D. Probert, J. Bruno. "Building fundamentally extensible application-
+specific operating systems in Space", March 1995.
+[3] D. Cheriton, K. Duda. "A caching model of operating system kernel
+functionality". In: Proc. Symp. on Operating Systems Design and
+Implementation, pages 179-194, Monterey CA (USA), 1994.
+[4] D. Engler, M. Kaashoek, and J. O'Toole Jr. "Exokernel: an operating
+system architecture for application-specific resource management",
+December 1995.
+
+If you don't want to go fetch the complete papers, here's a summary.
+The first 2 discuss the Space nanokernel, the 3rd discussed the cache
+nanokernel, and the last discusses exokernel.
+
+The complete Adeos approach has been thoroughly documented in a whitepaper
+published more than a year ago entitled "Adaptive Domain Environment
+for Operating Systems" and available here: http://www.opersys.com/adeos
+The current implementation is slightly different. Mainly, we do not
+implement the functionality to move Linux out of ring 0. Although of
+interest, this approach is not very portable.
+
+Instead, our patch taps right into Linux's main source of control
+over the hardware, the interrupt dispatching code, and inserts an
+interrupt pipeline which can then serve all the nanokernel's clients,
+including Linux.
+
+This is not a novelty in itself. Other OSes have been modified in such
+a way for a wide range of purposes. One of the most interesting
+examples is described by Stodolsky, Chen, and Bershad in a paper
+entitled "Fast Interrupt Priority Management in Operating System
+Kernels" published in 1993 as part of the Usenix Microkernels and
+Other Kernel Architectures Symposium. In that case, cli/sti were
+replaced by virtual cli/sti which did not modify the real interrupt
+mask in any way. Instead, interrupts were defered and delivered to
+the OS upon a call to the virtualized sti.
+
+Mainly, this resulted in increased performance for the OS. Although
+we haven't done any measurements on Linux's interrupt handling
+performance with Adeos, our nanokernel includes by definition the
+code implementing the technique described in the abovementioned
+Stodolsky paper, which we use to redirect the hardware interrupt flow
+to the pipeline.
+
+i386 and armnommu are currently supported. Most of the
+architecture-dependent code is easily portable to other architectures.
+
+Aside of adding the Adeos module (driver/adeos), we also modified some
+files to tap into Linux interrupt and system event dispatching (all
+the modifications are encapsulated in #ifdef CONFIG_ADEOS_*/#endif).
+
+We modified the idle task so it gives control back to Adeos in order for
+the ipipe to continue propagation.
+
+We modified init/main.c to initialize Adeos very early in the startup.
+
+Of course, we also added the appropriate makefile modifications and
+config options so that you can choose to enable/disable Adeos as
+part of the kernel build configuration.
+
+Adeos' public API is fully documented here:
+http://home.gna.org/adeos/doc/api/index.html.
+
+In Linux's case, adeos_register_domain() is called very early during
+system startup.
+
+To add your domain to the ipipe, you need to:
+1) Register your domain with Adeos using adeos_register_domain()
+2) Call adeos_virtualize_irq() for all the IRQs you wish to be
+notified about in the ipipe.
+
+That's it. Provided you gave Adeos appropriate handlers in step
+#2, your interrupts will be delivered via the ipipe.
+
+During runtime, you may change your position in the ipipe using
+adeos_renice_domain(). You may also stall/unstall the pipeline
+and change the ipipe's handling of the interrupts according to your
+needs.
+
+Over x86, Adeos supports SMP, and local/IO-APIC on UP.
+
+Here are some of the possible uses for Adeos (this list is far
+from complete):
+1) Much like User-Mode Linux, it should now be possible to have 2
+Linux kernels living side-by-side on the same hardware. In contrast
+to UML, this would not be 2 kernels one ontop of the other, but
+really side-by-side. Since Linux can be told at boot time to use
+only one portion of the available RAM, on a 128MB machine this
+would mean that the first could be made to use the 0-64MB space and
+the second would use the 64-128MB space. We realize that many
+modifications are required. Among other things, one of the 2 kernels
+will not need to conduct hardware initialization. Nevertheless, this
+possibility should be studied closer.
+
+2) It follows from #1 that adding other kernels beside Linux should
+be feasible. BSD is a prime candidate, but it would also be nice to
+see what virtualizers such as VMWare and Plex86 could do with Adeos.
+Proprietary operating systems could potentially also be accomodated.
+
+3) All the previous work that has been done on nanokernels should now
+be easily ported to Linux. Mainly, we would be very interested to
+hear about extensions to Adeos. Primarily, we have no mechanisms
+currently enabling multiple domains to share information. The papers
+mentioned earlier provide such mechanisms, but we'd like to see
+actual practical examples.
+
+4) Kernel debuggers' main problem (tapping into the kernel's
+interrupts) is solved and it should then be possible to provide
+patchless kernel debuggers. They would then become loadable kernel
+modules.
+
+5) Drivers who require absolute priority and dislike other kernel
+portions who use cli/sti can now create a domain of their own
+and place themselves before Linux in the ipipe. This provides a
+mechanism for the implementation of systems that can provide guaranteed
+realtime response.
