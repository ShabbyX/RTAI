	RTAI schedules as soon as a higher priority task is awaken in an
	interrupt handler, i.e. it does not wait to exit the handler itself.
	This is believed to be the best way, since a user that does not want
	it has just to care calling any scheduling API at the very end of
	her/his handler.
	Those wanting to have any awaken higher priority task scheduled only
	after exiting the ISR, regardless from where a scheduling API is

	help
	RTAI schedulers use a simple ordered linear list for suspended timed
	tasks by default. By enabling this option a binary sort type ordering
	is used. Such a scheme requires far less, albeit far more complex,
	operations to set up a time ordered list of wake up times. So when
	one has not so many tasks on the timed lists this option might not
	be worth having. The actual threshold value depends on many factors,
	CPU power being the main one. So it is up to you to make a choice.
	If you have many tens or even hundred(s) of timed tasks then it is

	This option also enables display of execution time of tasks, per thousand

config RTAI_ALLOW_RR

	By enabling this option it is possible to use round robin scheduling

	call to a suitable scheduler function.

config RTAI_FULL_PRINHER
	bool "Enable full priority inheritance"
	default n
	help
	In RTAI resource semaphores, aka mutexes, support two ways to
	manage priority inheritance, both for resource semaphores and
	intertask messages, blocked sent or rpced, to a task owning any
	resource semaphore already. Notice in fact that the task itself
	becomes a kind of "de facto" resource when any task blocks on it
	to exchange messages.
	Without enabling this option a task owning any resource will
	recover its base priority only when it releases the very last
	resource it owns. So full priority inheritance will work as
	it is usually expected for a singly owned resource only because,
	whenever a task achieves the ownership of more than one resource,
	priority inheritance will become an adaptive dynamic priority
	ceiling. In such a case in fact the task priority is increased
	according to the highest priority task waiting on any resource
	a task owns, itself included because of messages being exchanged
	with it, but it will be returned to its base priority only when all
	owned resources are released. This is a compromise design choice
	aimed at avoiding searches for the new priority to be inheredited
	across multiply owned resources and blocked tasks send/rpcing to
	the task.
	By enabling this configuration option instead you'll allow full
	priority inheritance, so that when a task releases any resource
	semaphore it owns it will acquire the priority of the most prioritary
	task, either waiting on any resource semaphore that it is still
	owned by the task or blocked send/rpcing to it.
	The choice is dependent on your needs mostly. Just take into account
	that the default dynamic priority ceiling is simpler, a bit more
	effective and less deadlock prone than full priority inheritance.

config RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	bool "Busy wait to ensure resume time alignment"
	default n
	help
	In oneshot mode there is a calibrated anticipation of the timer
	firing to compensate for the time consumed in scheduling.
	Sometimes, either because of a bad calibration or purposely, it is
	possibile to anticipate the scheduling by setting a larger than needed
	anticipation. In such cases with this option one can be sure to
	achieve the desired scheduling time at the expense of waisting
	processor time. Useful when there is enough computational power to
	waist in favour of precise schedule deadlines.
	Do not set it if a hard periodic timer is to be used.

config RTAI_LXRT_USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	bool "Use Linux syscall mechanism for RTAI calls from user space"
	default y
	help
	With this option enabled, RTAI uses the Linux syscall mechanism
	for its service calls, including RTAI own srqs, as provided by libc
	"syscall".  This may improve signal handling (and therefore debugging
	of RTAI applications), but has the drawback of a slight overhead.

	When direct inlining of RTAI syscalls is enabled, see the related
	configuration options, it is still possible to force the use of
	the Linux syscall mechanism, even if this configuration parameter
	has not been set. Notice that RTAI own srqs are inlined always.
	So, since it all depends on the definition of the USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	macro, the only thing to do is to add:
	#define USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which
	you want to use the Linux syscall mechanism, to be sure that the macro
	USE_LINUX_SYSCALL will not be redifined afterward. In the same way
	when this parameter is set you can selectively revert to RTAI own
	syscall mechanism by defining:
	#undef USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which
	you want to use the LXRT syscall mechanism.
	RTAI will then operate in mixed mode selectively by using both
	its own and Linux syscall mechanisms.

	If in doubt, say no.

config RTAI_ALIGN_LINUX_PRIORITY
	bool "Keep Linux task priority aligned to RTAI"
	default n
	help

	By enabling this option the RTAI scheduler will keep Linux tasks
	execution priority aligned to its. Naturally this makes sense
	either for Linux soft real time tasks enabled to use RTAI APIs,
	i.e. they issued rt_task_init/rt_task_init_schmod, or when RTAI
	hard real time tasks are given back to Linux.

config RTAI_ONE_SHOT
	bool "One-shot timer mode"
	default n
	help
	Set to enable one-shot timer mode as the default. If not set, the
	hard timer will run in periodic mode according to the period used
	in start_rt_timer().
	Notice that whatever the default setting chosen it is possible to
	override it by specifically calling either rt_set_oneshot_mode() or
	rt_set_periodic_mode() at run time.

config RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT
	string "Cure loosely calibrated frequencies - see help"
	default 0
	help
	This configuration parameter is meaningful for the oneshot mode only
	where it has two effects:
	1 - in oneshot mode using the APIC timer, i.e. always for SMP, a
	precise scheduling time depends also on the ratio cpu_freq/apic_freq.
	The best results can be achieved by using the RTAI calibration tool.
	If no calibration is run one will rely on what Linux makes available
	by default, which could be not precise enough, especially for not so
	short timed intervals.
 	That leads to large and systematic latencies, especially in the case
	of low frequency schedules. By setting this option to a suitable
	value one can be sure that a certain firing frequency is granted
	even when relatively large idle periods are enconuntered, thus
	limiting the overall latency with which long sleeping tasks might
	be awaken in case of unprecise calibrations of the above cited
	frequencies;
	2 - in the case of very long timed list it will limit the search
	for the next firing time of widely scattered tasks with lowest
	priorities, thus avoiding useless scheduling delays. The granted
	firing interval will be roughly equal to:
	1.0/(RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT + 2.0) (seconds).

config RTAI_BITS
	tristate "Event flags"
	default m
	help
	Event flags are used to synchronize a task to the occurrence of
	multiple events. RTAI uses the term "bits" to stress the fact that
	events are just logical objects, i.e. a kind of digital I/O,
	nothing else being associated to them, e.g a count.
	So any synchronization based on them may be disjunctive, when any
	of the events have occurred, or conjunctive, when all events have
	occured. The former corresponds to a logical OR whereas the latter
	is associated to a logical AND. Their use is similar to semaphores
	except that signal/waits are not related to just a simple counter
	but depends on the combination of set of bits.
	The module will be called rtai_bits.o.

	help
	Originally fifos were used to allow communication between

	of symmetric inter/intra kernel RTAI services, fifos are kept both
	for compatibility reasons and because they are very useful tools to be
	used to communicate with interrupt handlers only based applications,
	since they do not require any scheduler to be installed.

	  - allow two tasks to synchronize their activities.
	Resource semaphores can be recursively nested and support full
	priority inheritance, both among semaphore resources and
	intertask messages, for a singly owned resource.
	Priority inheritance becomes an adaptive priority ceiling when
	a task owns multiple resources, including messages sent to it.

	This let rt_poll alloc its dynamic data directly on the stack. It is
	likely the most effective way but it can deplete the stack somewhat,
	especially on 64 bits architectures, if polling requests are large,
	say > 40. Notice that even with smaller polling sizes it might be
	important to limit stack usage also when heavy preemptions, very high
	task switching rates and interrupts floodings are expected.
	By disabling this parameter RTAI will use its real time memory

config RTAI_TASKLETS
	tristate "Tasklets"
	default m
	help

	The tasklets module adds an interesting new feature along the
	line, pioneered by RTAI, of a symmetric usage of all its
	services inter-intra kernel and user space for both soft and
	hard real-time. The new services provided can be useful when
	you have many tasks, both in kernel and user space, needing to
	execute specific functions. Such functions are called tasklets
	and can be of two kinds:
        - a simple tasklet;
        - timed tasklets (timers).
	The tasklets implementation of timed tasklets relies on a
	server support task that executes the related timer functions,
	either in oneshot or periodic mode, on the base of their time
	deadline and according to their user assigned priority.
	As explained above, plain tasklets are just functions executed
	depending on user defined events. Their execution needs no server
	and is simply triggered by calling the user specified tasklet
	function at due time, either from a kernel task or interrupt
	handler in charge of their execution when they are needed.
	The module will be called rtai_tasklets.o.

	There are special signals tasklets also, natively built in always.
	They are much the same as tasklets and execute their handler
	function whenever they are triggered by any task, including their
	parent task. The notable difference against tasklets is that the
	task they serve is blocked till any of its signal handler is
	executing. So they behave as standard signal handlers but without
	the need to restart a blocked signalled task, since there is no
	need to have it resumed to catch a signal. In fact signals can be
	seen as much as software generated interrupts. See their APIs
	documentation in the code.
	The module will be called rtai_signal.o.

	Notice that, if the module version is chosen, this option activates
	the making of two different modules. At the moment the related
	services from user space are seen as LXRT expansions using slots
	1 and 2 respectively.

	The purpose here is mainly to activate the CLOCK_REALTIME timing

	CLOCK_REALTIME is the default POSIX timing option so it should be

	POSIX or can work with it using just the CLOCK_MONOTONIC timing,
	it would be better to avoid enabling this option. It will save you
	a test on a long long. Not too much of an overhead indeed, but why
	paying for it if not needed?
	It is defaulted to "yes" just to stay on the safe side.

config RTAI_USE_NEWERR
	bool "New return values of blocking RTAI APIs"
	default n
	help
	Return values for RTAI blocking APIs are a bit sketchy. That
	is due to a long standing legacy dating back to DOS and 8 bits PCs,
	when saving a few "if"s might have been important. Whatever one's
	opinion such a legacy has now been likely inheredited by many well
	working existing RTAI applications, that might break with a new
	error return scheme. In any case a better set of error return values
	might be useful nowadays, so it has been added. With it one will be
	able to correctly infer more detailed reasons for error returns i.e.:
	- invalid requests (RTE_OBJINV),
	- async unblocking (RTE_UNBLKD),
	- timeouts (RTE_TIMOUT),
	- timer overruns (RTE_TMROVRN),
	- deletion of blocking objects (RTE_OBJREM).
	Thus the new scheme has been made configurable to allow RTAI users
	to choose what to do, without forcing any adaption for already
	existing working applications.

config RTAI_IMMEDIATE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	bool "Immediate Linux syscall in hard real time"
	default n
	help
	This parameter allows to control RTAI behaviour when a Linux syscall
	is made while in hard real time, according to the following two ways:
	- 1) 	- if it is set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode;
		- call the related sys service immediately, i.e. without
		  going through the Linux syscall path;
		- put the task back to hard real time, so that it will return
		  to user space in hard real time mode again.
	- 2) 	- if it is not set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode;
		- call the related sys service through the Linux syscall path;
		- return to user space in soft real time mode;
		- resume hard real time at the next call of an RTAI function.
	The most efficient behaviour is 1 but 2 can be useful in relation to
	specific RTAI users extensions.
	It is remarked that nothing is changed if hard/soft transitions
	are called controlled by an application task through
	rt_make_hard_real_time/rt_make_soft_real_time.

config RTAI_MATH
	bool "Mathfuns support in kernel"
	depends on RTAI_FPU_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	This parameter allows buiding a module containing math support
	functions for kernel space. It might be useful to avoid fighting
	for the use of libc within the kernel.

config RTAI_MATH_C99
	bool "C99 standard support"
	depends on RTAI_MATH
	default n

config RTAI_MALLOC
	tristate "Real-time malloc support"
	default y
	help
	RTAI provides a real-time implementation of malloc(). This allows
	real-time tasks to allocate and to free memory safely while executing
	in the real-time domain.
	The module will be called rtai_malloc.o.

config RTAI_USE_TLSF
	bool "Allocate memory using TLSF in place of BSD one"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default n
	help
	RTAI dynamic memory allocation support offers two different methods
	to allocate memory chunks. The default one is along the lines
	illustrated in:
	"Design of a General Purpose Memory Allocator for the 4.3BSD Unix
	 Kernel" by Marshall K. McKusick.
	By enabling this option the:
	"Two Levels Segregated Lists (TLSF)" as found at:
	http://rtportal.upv.es/rtmalloc/allocators/tlsf/
	will be used instead.
	Rough measures seems to indicate small differences between the two
	in term of alloc/free times, likely with BSD being better for the
	tested allocation sizes (up to a few KBs), but TLSF seems to have
	better, i.e. lower, fragmentation properties. In any case you should
	check it yourself within your own applications.

config RTAI_MALLOC_VMALLOC
	bool "Use vmalloc() support"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default y
	help
	RTAI's malloc support offers two different ways to allocate memory
	chunks, i.e. kmalloc and vmalloc.
	The reasons for using vmalloc:
	- it is simpler to share allocated buffers with user space;
	- it doesn't have the size restrictions of kmalloc.
	The reasons for using kmalloc:
	- it is faster (not important since it as to be used in soft real time);
	- it exhibits contiguous buffer addressing needed for DMA controllers
	  which don't have scattering/gathering capability.
	The default is using kmalloc()

config RTAI_MALLOC_HEAPSZ
	string "Size of the global heap (Kbytes)"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default 128
	help
	RTAI pre-allocates a global heap as part of its initialization
	chores. This parameter allows to define its size (in
	kilobytes).

config RTAI_KSTACK_HEAPSZ
	string "Size of stacks heap for RTAI own kernel tasks (Kbytes)"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default 512
	help
	RTAI pre-allocates a heap for the stacks of its own kernel tasks.
	This parameter allows to define its size (in kilobytes).

config RTAI_TASK_SWITCH_SIGNAL
	bool "task switches specific signal"
	default n
	help
	RTAI can signal a task switch each time a task resumes execution.
	The way it is done depends on the execution space:
	- kernel: execute a function assigned at rt_task_init or by calling
	  rt_task_signal_handler;
	- user: install an RTAI own signal handler and have it called at any
	  task switch through its number, assigned by calling
	  rt_task_signal_handler.
	The default is to not make available this feature, so you must enable
	it explicitly if it is useful for your application.

config RTAI_TRACE
	bool "LTT support"
	default n
	help
	Originally, the Linux Trace Toolkit is a suite of tools
	designed to extract program execution details from the Linux
	operating system and interpret them. Specifically, it enables
	to extract processor utilization and allocation information
	for a certain period of time. It is then possible to perform
	various calculations on this data and dump this in a text
	file. This tool is enhanced by a GTK GUI which allows an easy
	exploitation of those results.  The Linux Trace Toolkit has
	been natively integrated into RTAI modules.
	You may refer to http://www.opersys.com/LTT/ for more information.

config RTAI_USI
	bool "User-space interrupts"
	default n
	help
	RTAI examples are available to show managing interrupts in user
	space, e.g: resumefromintr in "showroom" CVS (kernel/user/netrpc),
	"pressa" in "showroom" (user); but all of them require installing
	a proper handler in kernel space, to wake up a hard real-time user
	space task.
	The user space interrupt support does much of the same, but adds
	something that permits you to write nothing in kernel space.
	The module will be called rtai_usi.o.

config RTAI_WD
	bool "Watchdog support"
	default y
	help
	The purpose of the watchdog is to provide protection services
	to RTAI thereby protecting it (and the host Linux OS) against
	programming errors in RTAI applications.
	The RTAI module and a scheduler should be mounted to use the
	watchdog and once mounted, it will constantly monitor periodic
	real-time tasks that already exist, or that are created later.
	However this feature is optional and it is assumed that your
	RTAI applications are well behaved so that RTAI should behave
	the same whether or not you have the watchdog mounted. The
	overhead imposed by the watchdog depends on the speed that you
	run it, but in most cases should be minimal.
	The following watchdog policies are possible:
	- do nothing other than log some messages and keep a record of
	  the bad task;
	- resynchronise the task's frame time and nothing more;
	- debug policy which is a special case of the above
	  resynchronisation policy;
	- stretch the period of the offending task until it no longer
	  overruns;
	- slip the offending task by forcibly suspending it for a
	  percentage of its period;
	- suspend the offending task so that it no longer threaten the system;
	- kill the offending task and remove all traces.
	The module will be called rtai_wd.o.
