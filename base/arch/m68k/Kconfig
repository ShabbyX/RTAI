config RTAI_LONG_TIMED_LIST
	bool "Use a binary tree ordering for RTAI schedulers timed lists."
	default n
	help
	RTAI schedulers use a simple ordered linear list for suspended timed
	tasks by default. By enabling this option a binary sort type ordering 
	is used. Such a scheme requires far less, albeit far more complex, 
	operations to set up a time ordered list of wake up times. So when 
	one has not so many tasks on the timed lists this option might not 
	be worth having. The actual threshold value depends on many factors,
	CPU power being the main one. So it is up to you to make a choice.
	If you have many tens or even hundred(s) of timed tasks then it is 
	likely that it might be worth enabling this option.

config RTAI_SCHED_8254_LATENCY

	help
	The anticipation time to be used to program the hard timer, in oneshot

config RTAI_MONITOR_EXECTIME

	If this option is enabled it is possible to see the time consumed by
	hard real time tasks, in per thousand of the total time available, 
	by using the RTAI scheduler proc file, e.g. "cat /proc/rtai/scheduler".
	Since this option uses the TSC it is better to avoid it in production
	for x86 CPUs not having TSCs, i.e. 486s and some untrue 586s.

config RTAI_ALLOW_RR
	bool "Allow round-robin scheduling"
	default y
	help
	By enabling this option it is possible to use round robin scheduling
	in RTAI, after enabling such a mode on a task by task basis through a
	call to a suitable scheduler function.

config RTAI_FULL_PRINHER
	bool "Enable full priority inheritance"
	default n
	help
	In RTAI resource semaphores, aka mutexes, support two ways to
	manage priority inheritance, both for resource semaphores and 
	intertask messages, blocked sent or rpced, to a task owning any
	resource semaphore already. Notice in fact that the task itself
	becomes a kind of "de facto" resource when any task blocks on it
	to exchange messages. 
	Without enabling this option a task owning any resource will
	recover its base priority only when it releases the very last
	resource it owns. So full priority inheritance will work as
	it is usually expected for a singly owned resource only because,
	whenever a task achieves the ownership of more than one resource,
	priority inheritance will become an adaptive dynamic priority
	ceiling. In such a case in fact the task priority is increased
	according to the highest priority task waiting on any resource
	a task owns, itself included because of messages being exchanged
	with it, but it will be returned to its base priority only when all
	owned resources are released. This is a compromise design choice
	aimed at avoiding searches for the new priority to be inheredited
	across multiply owned resources and blocked tasks send/rpcing to
	the task.
	By enabling this configuration option instead you'll allow full
	priority inheritance, so that when a task releases any resource
	semaphore it owns it will acquire the priority of the most prioritary
	task, either waiting on any resource semaphore that it is still
	owned by the task or blocked send/rpcing to it.
	The choice is dependent on your needs mostly. Just take into account
	that the default dynamic priority ceiling is simpler, a bit more 
	effective and less deadlock prone than full priority inheritance.

config RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	bool "Busy wait to ensure resume time alignment"
	default n
	help
	In oneshot mode there is a calibrated anticipation of the timer
	firing to compensate for the time consumed in scheduling. 
	Sometimes, either because of a bad calibration or purposely, it is
	possibile to anticipate the scheduling by setting a larger than needed
	anticipation. In such cases with this option one can be sure to
	achieve the desired scheduling time at the expense of waisting
	processor time. Useful when there is enough computational power to 
	waist in favour of precise schedule deadlines.
	Do not set it if a hard periodic timer is to be used.

config RTAI_LXRT_USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	bool "Use Linux syscall mechanism for RTAI calls from user space"
	default y
	help
	With this option enabled, RTAI uses the Linux syscall mechanism
	for its service calls, including RTAI own srqs, as provided by libc 
	"syscall".  This may improve signal handling (and therefore debugging 
	of RTAI applications), but has the drawback of a slight overhead. 

	When direct inlining of RTAI syscalls is enabled, see the related
	configuration options, it is still possible to force the use of 
	the Linux syscall mechanism, even if this configuration parameter 
	has not been set. Notice that RTAI own srqs are inlined always.
	So, since it all depends on the definition of the USE_LINUX_SYSCALL 
	macro, the only thing to do is to add:
	#define USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which 
	you want to use the Linux syscall mechanism, to be sure that the macro
	USE_LINUX_SYSCALL will not be redifined afterward. In the same way 
	when this parameter is set you can selectively revert to RTAI own 
	syscall mechanism by defining:
	#undef USE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	after all of the RTAI headers inclusion in any source file in which 
	you want to use the LXRT syscall mechanism.
	RTAI will then operate in mixed mode selectively by using both 
	its own and Linux syscall mechanisms.
	
	If in doubt, say no.

config RTAI_ALIGN_LINUX_PRIORITY
	bool "Keep Linux task priority aligned to RTAI"
	default n
	help

	By enabling this option the RTAI scheduler will keep Linux tasks
	execution priority aligned to its. Naturally this makes sense
	either for Linux soft real time tasks enabled to use RTAI APIs, 
	i.e. they issued rt_task_init/rt_task_init_schmod, or when RTAI 
	hard real time tasks are given back to Linux. 

config RTAI_ONE_SHOT
	bool "One-shot timer mode"
	default n
	help
	Set to enable one-shot timer mode as the default. If not set, the 
	hard timer will run in periodic mode according to the period used 
	in start_rt_timer().
	Notice that whatever the default setting chosen it is possible to
	override it by specifically calling either rt_set_oneshot_mode() or 
	rt_set_periodic_mode() at run time.

config RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT
	string "Cure loosely calibrated frequencies - see help"
	default 0
	help
	This configuration parameter is meaningful for the oneshot mode only
	where it has two effects:
	1 - in oneshot mode using the APIC timer, i.e. always for SMP, a 
	precise scheduling time depends also on the ratio cpu_freq/apic_freq. 
	The best results can be achieved by using the RTAI calibration tool. 
	If no calibration is run one will rely on what Linux makes available 
	by default, which could be not precise enough, especially for not so 
	short timed intervals.
 	That leads to large and systematic latencies, especially in the case
	of low frequency schedules. By setting this option to a suitable
	value one can be sure that a certain firing frequency is granted 
	even when relatively large idle periods are enconuntered, thus
	limiting the overall latency with which long sleeping tasks might
	be awaken in case of unprecise calibrations of the above cited
	frequencies;
	2 - in the case of very long timed list it will limit the search 
	for the next firing time of widely scattered tasks with lowest 
	priorities, thus avoiding useless scheduling delays. The granted 
	firing interval will be roughly equal to:
	1.0/(RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT + 2.0) (seconds).

	help
	RPC means Remote Procedure Call. The NetRPC implementation
	corresponds to a synchronous intertask message passing which
	is the old concept and the basis of microkernels, either
	distributed or not.  Using NetRPC makes from RTAI a
	distributed system, both for kernel and user space
	applications.
	NetRPC depends on a messaging support, if none is provided it relies
	on Linux network services, thus loosing strict real time. See the
	RTNet emulation option.
	The NetRPC module will be called rtai_netrpc.o.

config RTAI_NETRPC_RTNET
	bool "Use RTNet"
	depends on RTAI_NETRPC

	help
	This enable support of RTNet in NETRPC. By setting this parameters hard 
	real time will use RTNet automatically, while soft real time task will 
	use Linux networking. With this parameter set the making of RTAI will 
	work even if RTNet is not installed but you'll need RTNet to run it.
	Notice that the initial linking and set up of remote port stubs is 
	done in soft mode always.

config RTAI_SHM

	default m
	help
	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra
	real-time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls
	can be used both in real-time tasks (within the kernel) and
	Linux processes.

	services.

config RTAI_RT_POLL_ON_STACK
	bool "Use the stack for rt_poll dynamic arrays"
	depends on RTAI_RT_POLL
	default n
	help
	This let rt_poll alloc its dynamic data directly on the stack. It is
	likely the most effective way but it can deplete the stack somewhat,
	especially on 64 bits architectures, if polling requests are large,
	say > 40. Notice that even with smaller polling sizes it might be
	important to limit stack usage also when heavy preemptions, very high
	task switching rates and interrupts floodings are expected.
	By disabling this parameter RTAI will use its real time memory
	allocation; with it the limits are just in the size you set for the
	RTAI dynamic heap and in a slightly greater overhead. So for reasons
	of cautiousness the default setting is not to use the stack.

config RTAI_CLOCK_REALTIME
	bool "Support for Posix CLOCK_REALTIME APIs"
	default y
	help
	The purpose here is mainly to activate the CLOCK_REALTIME timing 
	support in a few RTAI native services used behind POSIX APIs.
	CLOCK_REALTIME is the default POSIX timing option so it should be
	enabled for a full POSIX support but, if you are either not using 
	POSIX or can work with it using just the CLOCK_MONOTONIC timing, 
	it would be better to avoid enabling this option. It will save you 
	a test on a long long. Not too much of an overhead indeed, but why 
	paying for it if not needed?
	It is defaulted to "yes" just to stay on the safe side.

config RTAI_USE_NEWERR
	bool "New return values of blocking RTAI APIs"
	default n
	help
	Return values for RTAI blocking APIs are a bit sketchy. That 
	is due to a long standing legacy dating back to DOS and 8 bits PCs,
	when saving a few "if"s might have been important. Whatever one's 
	opinion such a legacy has now been likely inheredited by many well
	working existing RTAI applications, that might break with a new 
	error return scheme. In any case a better set of error return values 
	might be useful nowadays, so it has been added. With it one will be
	able to correctly infer more detailed reasons for error returns i.e.:
	- invalid requests (RTE_OBJINV),
	- async unblocking (RTE_UNBLKD),
	- timeouts (RTE_TIMOUT),
	- timer overruns (RTE_TMROVRN),
	- deletion of blocking objects (RTE_OBJREM).
	Thus the new scheme has been made configurable to allow RTAI users
	to choose what to do, without forcing any adaption for already 
	existing working applications.

config RTAI_IMMEDIATE_LINUX_SYSCALL
	bool "Immediate Linux syscall in hard real time"
	default n
	help
	This parameter allows to control RTAI behaviour when a Linux syscall
	is made while in hard real time, according to the following two ways:
	- 1) 	- if it is set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode; 
		- call the related sys service immediately, i.e. without 
		  going through the Linux syscall path;
		- put the task back to hard real time, so that it will return
		  to user space in hard real time mode again.
	- 2) 	- if it is not set RTAI will put the task back into Linux hands,
		  i.e pass it to soft mode; 
		- call the related sys service through the Linux syscall path;
		- return to user space in soft real time mode;
		- resume hard real time at the next call of an RTAI function.
	The most efficient behaviour is 1 but 2 can be useful in relation to
	specific RTAI users extensions.
	It is remarked that nothing is changed if hard/soft transitions 
	are called controlled by an application task through 
	rt_make_hard_real_time/rt_make_soft_real_time.

	RTAI dynamic memory allocation support offers two different methods
	to allocate memory chunks. The default one is along the lines 
	illustrated in:
	"Design of a General Purpose Memory Allocator for the 4.3BSD Unix
	 Kernel" by Marshall K. McKusick. 
	By enabling this option the:
	"Two Levels Segregated Lists (TLSF)" as found at:
	http://rtportal.upv.es/rtmalloc/allocators/tlsf/
	will be used instead.
	Rough measures seems to indicate small differences between the two
	in term of alloc/free times, likely with BSD being better for the
	tested allocation sizes (up to a few KBs), but TLSF seems to have
	better, i.e. lower, fragmentation properties. In any case you should
	check it yourself within your own applications.

config RTAI_MALLOC_HEAPSZ

config RTAI_TASK_SWITCH_SIGNAL
	bool "task switches specific signal"
	default n
	help
	RTAI can signal a task switch each time a task resumes execution.
	The way it is done depends on the execution space:
	- kernel: execute a function assigned at rt_task_init or by calling
	  rt_task_signal_handler;
	- user: install an RTAI own signal handler and have it called at any
	  task switch through its number, assigned by calling

	Originally, the Linux Trace Toolkit is a suite of tools

	to extract processor utilization and allocation information
	for a certain period of time. It is then possible to perform
	various calculations on this data and dump this in a text
	file. This tool is enhanced by a GTK GUI which allows an easy
