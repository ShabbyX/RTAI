	one has not so many tasks on the timed lists this option might not 
	be worth having. The actual threshold value depends on many factors,

#	could be some anticipation, i.e. a negative latency, for a kernel space
#	task. The busy alignment option should be used in such a case to

config RTAI_SCHED_APIC_LATENCY

        help
        The anticipation time to be used to program the hard timer mode for
	the next scheduling shot, in order to compensate for the programming
	overhead determing the right firing time.
	It could be determined with the calibration support provided by RTAI, 
	starting from a tentative configuration; better if set to zero for
	the first calibration, i.e. the default value available at the very 
	first config-making. 
	The same value is used for both kernel and user space tasks. Which
	means that, for an appropriate on time user space task, there could be 
	some anticipation for a kernel space task, i.e. a negative latency. 
	In such a case, the busy alignment option could be used to provide a 
	compromised on time scheduling for both, albeit at a negligible added 
	cost for kernel tasks.
	It should be remarked that if such a value is left to zero at the
	very first config, RTAI will self calibrate in user space, resetting 
	the related configuration files with the new values. The user can 
	then further tune such values at will. 
	In such a vew the self calibration will:
	- set the scheduler latency;
	- enable a busy wait alignment, see the related config parameter;
	- set an appropriate busy wait anticipation for kernel space; see 
	  the related config parameter;
	- set a negative appropriate busy wait anticipation for user space, 
	  the adoption of a negative value will impede the alignment, while
	  its absolute value will be an appropriate indication of what 
	  should be used if also a user space alignment is desired; see the 
	  related config parameter. It should nonetheless be remarked that,
	  because of the calibration in user space, there should be no need
	  to align. 

config RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	bool "Busy wait to ensure resume time alignment"
	default n
	help
	As explained for the scheduling latency parameter, RTAI has a 
	calibrated anticipation of the timer firing, to compensate for
	the time overhead consumed in scheduling. 
	Sometimes, either because of a bad calibration or purposely, it is
	possible to anticipate the scheduling by setting a slightly larger 
	than needed anticipation, followed by a busy wait of the right 
	syncronized time. In such cases, with this option, one can be sure to
	achieve the desired scheduling time at the expense of wasting a 
	negligeable processor time. Useful to achieve more precise scheduling
	deadlines and non negative latency values.
	Usually, since a user space calibration is preferred, the latency 
	value will results in being higher than needed for RTAI kernel tasks.
	Then setting this option will allow to achieve sharper deadlines 
	for kernel tasks, avoiding their anticipated schedules.
	Enabling this parameter will have no effect if the specific 
	kernel/user space alignment time is not set to a positive value.
	See the related parameters help.

config RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY

	The average time to return to the timed calling function after 
	switching back to a kernel space task. 
	It is subtracted from the resume time of a timed task to avoid 
	a delayed return when a busy wait to align to the resume time is 
	assigned.
	A <= 0 value will skip the busy alignment, as if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	was not set. Useful to allow the alignment application just for kernel 
	tasks. For example when a precise calibration for user space is used, 
	a kernel task will anticipate its timed resumption; so setting a 
	positive value here and a <= 0 busy wait time for the corresponding 
	user space option will allow applying the busy wait just to kernel 
	tasks.

config RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY

	It is subtracted from the resume time of a timed task to avoid 
	a delayed return when a busy wait to align to the resume time is
	requested.
	A <= 0 value will skip the busy alignment, as if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN

	hard real time tasks, in per thousand of the total time available, 
	by using the RTAI scheduler proc file, e.g. "cat /proc/rtai/scheduler".
	Since this option uses the TSC it is better to avoid it in production

config RTAI_ALLOW_RR

	call to a suitable scheduler function.

config RTAI_FULL_PRINHER
	bool "Enable full priority inheritance"
	default n
	help
	In RTAI resource semaphores, aka mutexes, support two ways to
	manage priority inheritance, both for resource semaphores and 
	intertask messages, blocked sent or rpced, to a task owning any
	resource semaphore already. Notice in fact that the task itself
	becomes a kind of "de facto" resource when any task blocks on it
	to exchange messages. 
	Without enabling this option a task owning any resource will
	recover its base priority only when it releases the very last
	resource it owns. So full priority inheritance will work as
	it is usually expected for a singly owned resource only because,
	whenever a task achieves the ownership of more than one resource,
	priority inheritance will become an adaptive dynamic priority
	ceiling. In such a case in fact the task priority is increased
	according to the highest priority task waiting on any resource
	a task owns, itself included because of messages being exchanged
	with it, but it will be returned to its base priority only when all
	owned resources are released. This is a compromise design choice
	aimed at avoiding searches for the new priority to be inherited
	across multiply owned resources and blocked tasks send/rpcing to
	the task.
	By enabling this configuration option instead you'll allow full
	priority inheritance, so that when a task releases any resource
	semaphore it owns it will acquire the priority of the most prioritary
	task, either waiting on any resource semaphore that it is still
	owned by the task or blocked send/rpcing to it.
	The choice is dependent on your needs mostly. Just take into account
	that the default dynamic priority ceiling is simpler, a bit more 
	effective and less deadlock prone than full priority inheritance.

config RTAI_ALIGN_LINUX_PRIORITY
	bool "Keep Linux task priority aligned to RTAI"
	default n
	help

	By enabling this option the RTAI scheduler will keep Linux tasks
	execution priority aligned to its. Naturally this makes sense
	either for Linux soft real time tasks enabled to use RTAI APIs, 
	i.e. they issued rt_task_init/rt_task_init_schmod, or when RTAI 
	hard real time tasks are given back to Linux. 

config RTAI_ONE_SHOT
	bool "One-shot timer mode"
	default n
	help
	Set to enable one-shot timer mode as the default. If not set, the 
	hard timer will run in periodic mode according to the period used 
	in start_rt_timer().
	Notice that whatever the default setting chosen it is possible to
	override it by specifically calling either rt_set_oneshot_mode() or 
	rt_set_periodic_mode() at run time.

config RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT
	string "Cure loosely calibrated frequencies - see help"
	default 0
	help
	This configuration parameter is meaningful for the oneshot mode only
	where it has two effects:
	1 - in oneshot mode using the APIC timer, i.e. always for SMP, a 
	precise scheduling time depends also on the ratio cpu_freq/apic_freq. 
	The best results can be achieved by using the RTAI calibration tool. 
	If no calibration is run one will rely on what Linux makes available 
	by default, which could be not precise enough, especially for not so 
	short timed intervals.
 	That leads to large and systematic latencies, especially in the case
	of low frequency schedules. By setting this option to a suitable
	value one can be sure that a certain firing frequency is granted 
	even when relatively large idle periods are encountered, thus
	limiting the overall latency with which long sleeping tasks might
	be awaken in case of imprecise calibrations of the above cited
	frequencies;
	2 - in the case of very long timed list it will limit the search 
	for the next firing time of widely scattered tasks with lowest 
	priorities, thus avoiding useless scheduling delays. The granted 
	firing interval will be roughly equal to:
	1.0/(RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT + 2.0) (seconds).

config RTAI_BITS

	default m

	Event flags are used to synchronize a task to the occurrence of 
	multiple events. RTAI uses the term "bits" to stress the fact that
	events are just logical objects, i.e. a kind of digital I/O, 
	nothing else being associated to them, e.g a count. 
	So any synchronization based on them may be disjunctive, when any 
	of the events have occurred, or conjunctive, when all events have 
	occurred. The former corresponds to a logical OR whereas the latter 
	is associated to a logical AND. Their use is similar to semaphores

	By disabling this parameter RTAI will use its real time memory

config RTAI_TASKLETS

	default m
	help

	The tasklets module adds an interesting new feature along the
	line, pioneered by RTAI, of a symmetric usage of all its
	services inter-intra kernel and user space for both soft and
	hard real-time. The new services provided can be useful when
	you have many tasks, both in kernel and user space, needing to
	execute specific functions. Such functions are called tasklets 
	and can be of two kinds:
        - a simple tasklet;
        - timed tasklets (timers).
	The tasklets implementation of timed tasklets relies on a
	server support task that executes the related timer functions,
	either in oneshot or periodic mode, on the base of their time
	deadline and according to their user assigned priority.
	As explained above, plain tasklets are just functions executed
	depending on user defined events. Their execution needs no server 
	and is simply triggered by calling the user specified tasklet
	function at due time, either from a kernel task or interrupt
	handler in charge of their execution when they are needed.
	The module will be called rtai_tasklets.o.

	There are special signals tasklets also, natively built in always.
	They are much the same as tasklets and execute their handler
	function whenever they are triggered by any task, including their
	parent task. The notable difference against tasklets is that the
	task they serve is blocked till any of its signal handler is 
	executing. So they behave as standard signal handlers but without
	the need to restart a blocked signalled task, since there is no
	need to have it resumed to catch a signal. In fact signals can be 
	seen as much as software generated interrupts. See their APIs
	documentation in the code.
	The module will be called rtai_signal.o.

	Notice that, if the module version is chosen, this option activates
	the making of two different modules. At the moment the related
	services from user space are seen as LXRT expansions using slots
	1 and 2 respectively.

config RTAI_MQ
	tristate "POSIX-like message queues"
	depends on RTAI_SEM
	default y if RTAI_SEM=y
	default m if RTAI_SEM=m
	help
	RTAI pqueues implements the message queues section of Posix 1003.1d. 
	They provide kernel-safe message queues. Message queues depend on 
	semaphores.
	The module will be called rtai_mq.o.

config RTAI_CLOCK_REALTIME
	bool "Support for Posix CLOCK_REALTIME APIs"
	default y
	help
	The purpose here is mainly to activate the CLOCK_REALTIME timing 
	support in a few RTAI native services used behind POSIX APIs.
	CLOCK_REALTIME is the default POSIX timing option so it should be
	enabled for a full POSIX support but, if you are either not using 
	POSIX or can work with it using just the CLOCK_MONOTONIC timing, 
	it would be better to avoid enabling this option. It will save you 
	a test on a long long. Not too much of an overhead indeed, but why 
	paying for it if not needed?
	It is defaulted to "yes" just to stay on the safe side.

config RTAI_USE_NEWERR
	bool "New return values of blocking RTAI APIs"
	default y
	help
	Return values for RTAI blocking APIs are a bit sketchy. That 
	is due to a long standing legacy dating back to DOS and 8 bits PCs,
	when saving a few "if"s might have been important. Whatever one's 
	opinion such a legacy has now been likely inherited by many well
	working existing RTAI applications, that might break with a new 
	error return scheme. In any case a better set of error return values 
	might be useful nowadays, so it has been added. With it one will be
	able to correctly infer more detailed reasons for error returns i.e.:
	- invalid requests (RTE_OBJINV),
	- async unblocking (RTE_UNBLKD),
	- timeouts (RTE_TIMOUT),
	- timer overruns (RTE_TMROVRN),
	- deletion of blocking objects (RTE_OBJREM).
	Thus the new scheme has been made configurable to allow RTAI users
	to choose what to do, without forcing any adaption for already 
	existing working applications.

config RTAI_MATH
	bool "Mathfuns support in kernel"
	depends on RTAI_FPU_SUPPORT
	default n
	help
	This parameter allows building a module containing math support 
	functions for kernel space. It might be useful to avoid fighting
	for the use of libc within the kernel.

#	bool "C99 standard support"
#	depends on RTAI_MATH
#	default n

config RTAI_MALLOC
	tristate "Real-time malloc support"
	default y
	help
	RTAI provides a real-time implementation of malloc(). This allows 
	real-time tasks to allocate and free memory safely while executing
	in the real-time domain. If it is not enabled kernel's kmalloc will
	be used. So disabling this option is acceptable if you'll care 
	to do any allocation while in Linux context only, i.e. at modules
	initialisation.
	The module will be called rtai_malloc.o.

config RTAI_USE_TLSF
	bool "Allocate memory using TLSF in place of BSD one"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default n
	help
	RTAI dynamic memory allocation support offers two different methods
	to allocate memory chunks. The default one is along the lines 
	illustrated in:
	"Design of a General Purpose Memory Allocator for the 4.3BSD Unix
	 Kernel" by Marshall K. McKusick. 
	By enabling this option the:
	"Two Levels Segregated Lists (TLSF)" as found at:
	http://rtportal.upv.es/rtmalloc/allocators/tlsf/
	will be used instead.
	Rough measures seems to indicate small differences between the two
	in term of alloc/free times, likely with BSD being better for the
	tested allocation sizes (up to a few KBs), but TLSF seems to have
	better, i.e. lower, fragmentation properties. In any case you should
	check it yourself within your own applications.

config RTAI_MALLOC_VMALLOC
	bool "Use vmalloc() support"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default y
	help
	RTAI's malloc support offers two different ways to allocate memory 
	chunks, i.e. kmalloc and vmalloc.
	The reasons for using vmalloc:
	- it is simpler to share allocated buffers with user space;
	- it doesn't have the size restrictions of kmalloc.
	The reasons for using kmalloc:
	- it is faster (not important since it as to be used in soft real time);
	- it exhibits contiguous buffer addressing needed for DMA controllers 
	  which don't have scattering/gathering capability.
	The default is using kmalloc()

config RTAI_MALLOC_HEAPSZ
	string "Size of the global heap (Kbytes)"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default 2048
	help
	RTAI pre-allocates a global heap as part of its initialization
	chores. This parameter allows to define its size (in
	kilobytes).

config RTAI_KSTACK_HEAPSZ
	string "Size of stacks heap for RTAI own kernel tasks (Kbytes)"
	depends on RTAI_MALLOC
	default 512
	help
	RTAI pre-allocates a heap for the stacks of its own kernel tasks.
	This parameter allows to define its size (in kilobytes).

config RTAI_TASK_SWITCH_SIGNAL
	bool "task switches specific signal"
	default n
	help
	RTAI can signal a task switch each time a task resumes execution.
	The way it is done depends on the execution space:
	- kernel: execute a function assigned at rt_task_init or by calling
	  rt_task_signal_handler;
	- user: install an RTAI own signal handler and have it called at any
	  task switch through its number, assigned by calling 
	  rt_task_signal_handler.
	The default is to not make available this feature, so you must enable
	it explicitly if it is useful for your application.

config RTAI_USI
	bool "User-space interrupts"
	default n
	help
	RTAI examples are available to show managing interrupts in user 
	space, e.g: resumefromintr in "showroom" CVS (kernel/user/netrpc),
	"pressa" in "showroom" (user); but all of them require installing
	a proper handler in kernel space, to wake up a hard real-time user
	space task.
	The user space interrupt support does much of the same, but adds 
	something that permits you to write nothing in kernel space.
	The module will be called rtai_usi.o.
	

config RTAI_WD
	bool "Watchdog support"
	default n
	help
	The purpose of the watchdog is to provide protection services
	to RTAI thereby protecting it (and the host Linux OS) against
	programming errors in RTAI applications.
	The RTAI module and a scheduler should be mounted to use the
	watchdog and once mounted, it will constantly monitor periodic
	real-time tasks that already exist, or that are created later.
	However this feature is optional and it is assumed that your
	RTAI applications are well behaved so that RTAI should behave
	the same whether or not you have the watchdog mounted. The
	overhead imposed by the watchdog depends on the speed that you
	run it, but in most cases should be minimal.
	The following watchdog policies are possible:
	- do nothing other than log some messages and keep a record of
	  the bad task; 
	- resynchronise the task's frame time and nothing more;
	- debug policy which is a special case of the above
	  resynchronisation policy; 
	- stretch the period of the offending task until it no longer
	  overruns; 
	- slip the offending task by forcibly suspending it for a
	  percentage of its period; 
	- suspend the offending task so that it no longer threaten the system;
	- kill the offending task and remove all traces.
	The module will be called rtai_wd.o.

config RTAI_HARD_SOFT_TOGGLER
	bool "Install Linux signal handler to toggle hard-soft modes"
	default n
	help
	By setting this option RTAI will install a Linux signal (SIGUSR1) and 
	handler, when any of the available task-thread init functions is called
	to enable the usage of its own APIs. With it is possible to toggle the 
	hard-soft mode of any task, asynchronously and outside of it, by using 
	some form of KILL, i.e.: "kill -USR1 <pid>" from a shell, or 
	"kill(pid, SIGUSR1)" from a C function. For the latter case the helper 
	function "pid_t rt_get_linux_tid(RT_TASK *rt_task)" has been added to
	help in quickly getting the pid of the RTAI task extension "rt_task" 
	of a Linux task.

	You can set the path to COMEDI installation directory here. 
	It will be found either in Linux, since 2.6.29 (circa), see README
	in "addons/comedi" for what to do in such a case, or by getting 
        kcomedi from www.comedi.org, in which case RTAI needs the file

config RTAI_USE_COMEDI_LOCK
	depends on RTAI_COMEDI_LXRT
	bool "Use COMEDI lock by default"
	default "n"
	help
	You may need the COMEDI lock for data acquisition when sharing a
	board among many users. You can lock/unlock explicitly any 
	operation by calling comedi_lock/unlock yourself. By setting this
	parameter all functions needing a lock for a safe shared use are
	lock/unlocked by default. It can be useful to save a couple of
	calls to enforce locking from user space. Little is gained with it
	in kernel space.
