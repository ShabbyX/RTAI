	help
	Allows choosing among:
	- Never inline:         i.e. user-space services are linked to 
	  programs against the appropriate support library (e.g. liblxrt.a 
	  for user space RTAI syscall services).
	- Eager inlining:       i.e. static inline, always inline regardless 
	  of compiler's optimization switch;

config RTAI_DONT_DISPATCH_CORE_IRQS
	bool "Direct vectoring of RTAI native interrupts"
	default y
	help

	RTAI dispatches real time interrupts immediately to achieve as
	low a overhead as possible. Very important on low end CPUs. By
	setting this option it is possible to achieve a further improvement
	by allowing hard RTAI internal timers and SMP interprocessor 
	scheduling interrupts to be vectored directly to their handlers, 
	i.e without any dispatching overhead. A must on low end CPUs.

config RTAI_FPU_SUPPORT
	bool "Enable FPU support"
	default y
	help
	The FPU executes instructions from the processor's normal
	instruction stream. It can handle the types of high-precision
	floating-point processing operations commonly found in
	scientific, engineering, and business applications.  Enabling
	FPU support on a platform providing this hardware component
	may greatly improve performances.  You can obtain more
	information about Float-Point Unit on x86 platform on
	internet at the following URL:
	http://www.intel.com/design/intarch/techinfo/Pentium/fpu.htm

config RTAI_CPUS
	string "Number of CPUs (SMP-only)"
	default 2
	help
	RTAI has native support for Symmetrical Multi-Processing
	machines. If it is your case, you may want to enter here the
	number of CPUs of your motherboard.

	PAY ATTENTION: the default value is 2.

config RTAI_DIAG_TSC_SYNC
	bool "Diagnose out of sync MP-TSCs"
	default n
	help
	Check alignment of MP-TSCs, against a master CPU, and show them in
	the RTAI HAL proc file system (in TSC count units).

	bool "Tune out of sync MP-TSCs"
	default n

	Use offsets made available by enabling the out of sync diagnosis to
	keep readings of TSCs times as aligned as possible.

#config RTAI_SCHED_8254_LATENCY
#	string "8254 tuning latency (ns)"
#	default 4700
#	help
#	The anticipation time to be used to program the hard timer, in oneshot
#	mode, for the next scheduling shot in order to compensate for the
#	programming overhead needed to determine the right firing time.
#	This parameter has no effect when the periodic mode is used.
#	It should be determined with the calibration support provided by RTAI, 
#	starting from a tentative configuration; better if set to zero
#	for the very first calibration. 
#	The same value is used as a compromise for both kernel and 
#	user space tasks. Which means that for an on time user space task there 
#	could be some anticipation, i.e. a negative latency, for a kernel space
#	task. The busy alignment option should be used in such a case to
#	provide a compromised on time scheduling for both, albeit at a 
#	negligible added cost.

	default m
	help
	This RTAI specific module allows sharing memory inter-intra
	real-time tasks and Linux processes. In fact it can be an
	alternative to the SYSTEM V shared memory. It may also be
	noticed that the services are symmetrical, i.e. the same calls
	can be used both in real-time tasks (within the kernel) and
	Linux processes.
	The module will be called rtai_shm.o.

	help
	RTAI pre-allocates a global heap as part of its initialization
	chores. This parameter allows to define its size (in
	kilobytes).

#config RTAI_HARD_SOFT_TOGGLER
#	bool "Install Linux signal handler to toggle hard-soft modes"
#	default n
#	help
#	By setting this option RTAI will install a Linux signal (SIGUSR1) and 
#	handler, when any of the available task-thread init functions is called
#	to enable the usage of its own APIs. With it is possible to toggle the 
#	hard-soft mode of any task, asynchronously and outside of it, by using 
#	some form of KILL, i.e.: "kill -USR1 <pid>" from a shell, or 
#	"kill(pid, SIGUSR1)" from a C function. For the latter case the helper 
#	function "pid_t rt_get_linux_tid(RT_TASK *rt_task)" has been added to
#	help in quickly getting the pid of the RTAI task extension "rt_task" 
#	of a Linux task.
