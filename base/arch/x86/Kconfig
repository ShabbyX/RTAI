	RTAI schedulers use a simple ordered linear list for suspended timed

config RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	bool "Busy wait to ensure resume time alignment"
	default n
	help
	In oneshot mode there is a calibrated anticipation of the timer
	firing to compensate for the time overhead consumed in scheduling. 
	Sometimes, either because of a bad calibration or purposely, it is
	possible to anticipate the scheduling by setting a slightly larger than 
	needed anticipation. In such cases with this option one can be sure to
	achieve the desired scheduling time at the expense of waisting some
	processor time. Useful to achieve both more precise scheduled deadlines
	and non negative latency values.
	Do not set it if a hard periodic timer is to be used.
	Since a user space task has a higher scheduling latency, it can be
	usefully set to allow achieving better deadlines for kernel tasks, when
	the scheduling latency is calibrated for user space tasks.
	For more precise results see the following options.

	A zero value will skip the busy alignment, as if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN
	was not set. Useful to allow the alignment application just to kernel 
	or user tasks. For example when a precise calibration for user space 
	is used, a kernel task will anticipate its timed resumption; so setting
	a positive value here and a zero for the corresponding option 
	below will allow applying the busy wait just to kernel tasks.

	hard real time tasks, in per thousand of the total time available, 
	by using the RTAI scheduler proc file, e.g. "cat /proc/rtai/scheduler".
	Since this option uses the TSC it is better to avoid it in production

config RTAI_FULL_PRINHER
	bool "Enable full priority inheritance"
	default n
	help
	In RTAI resource semaphores, aka mutexes, support two ways to
	manage priority inheritance, both for resource semaphores and 
	intertask messages, blocked sent or rpced, to a task owning any
	resource semaphore already. Notice in fact that the task itself
	becomes a kind of "de facto" resource when any task blocks on it
	to exchange messages. 
	Without enabling this option a task owning any resource will
	recover its base priority only when it releases the very last
	resource it owns. So full priority inheritance will work as
	it is usually expected for a singly owned resource only because,
	whenever a task achieves the ownership of more than one resource,
	priority inheritance will become an adaptive dynamic priority
	ceiling. In such a case in fact the task priority is increased
	according to the highest priority task waiting on any resource
	a task owns, itself included because of messages being exchanged
	with it, but it will be returned to its base priority only when all
	owned resources are released. This is a compromise design choice
	aimed at avoiding searches for the new priority to be inherited
	across multiply owned resources and blocked tasks send/rpcing to
	the task.
	By enabling this configuration option instead you'll allow full
	priority inheritance, so that when a task releases any resource
	semaphore it owns it will acquire the priority of the most prioritary
	task, either waiting on any resource semaphore that it is still
	owned by the task or blocked send/rpcing to it.
	The choice is dependent on your needs mostly. Just take into account
	that the default dynamic priority ceiling is simpler, a bit more 
	effective and less deadlock prone than full priority inheritance.

config RTAI_ALIGN_LINUX_PRIORITY
	bool "Keep Linux task priority aligned to RTAI"
	default n
	help

	By enabling this option the RTAI scheduler will keep Linux tasks
	execution priority aligned to its. Naturally this makes sense
	either for Linux soft real time tasks enabled to use RTAI APIs, 
	i.e. they issued rt_task_init/rt_task_init_schmod, or when RTAI 
	hard real time tasks are given back to Linux. 

config RTAI_ONE_SHOT
	bool "One-shot timer mode"
	default n
	help
	Set to enable one-shot timer mode as the default. If not set, the 
	hard timer will run in periodic mode according to the period used 
	in start_rt_timer().
	Notice that whatever the default setting chosen it is possible to
	override it by specifically calling either rt_set_oneshot_mode() or 
	rt_set_periodic_mode() at run time.

config RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT
	string "Cure loosely calibrated frequencies - see help"
	default 0
	help
	This configuration parameter is meaningful for the oneshot mode only
	where it has two effects:
	1 - in oneshot mode using the APIC timer, i.e. always for SMP, a 
	precise scheduling time depends also on the ratio cpu_freq/apic_freq. 
	The best results can be achieved by using the RTAI calibration tool. 
	If no calibration is run one will rely on what Linux makes available 
	by default, which could be not precise enough, especially for not so 
	short timed intervals.
 	That leads to large and systematic latencies, especially in the case
	of low frequency schedules. By setting this option to a suitable
	value one can be sure that a certain firing frequency is granted 
	even when relatively large idle periods are encountered, thus
	limiting the overall latency with which long sleeping tasks might
	be awaken in case of imprecise calibrations of the above cited
	frequencies;
	2 - in the case of very long timed list it will limit the search 
	for the next firing time of widely scattered tasks with lowest 
	priorities, thus avoiding useless scheduling delays. The granted 
	firing interval will be roughly equal to:
	1.0/(RTAI_CAL_FREQS_FACT + 2.0) (seconds).

config RTAI_RT_POLL_ON_STACK
	bool "Use the stack for rt_poll dynamic arrays"
	depends on RTAI_RT_POLL
	default n
	help
	This let rt_poll allocate its dynamic data directly on the stack. It is
	likely the most effective way but it can deplete the stack somewhat,
	especially on 64 bits architectures, if polling requests are large,
	say > 40. Notice that even with smaller polling sizes it might be
	important to limit stack usage also when heavy preemptions, very high
	task switching rates and interrupts flooding are expected.
	By disabling this parameter RTAI will use its real time memory
	allocation; with it the limits are just in the size you set for the
	RTAI dynamic heap and in a slightly greater overhead. So for reasons
	of cautiousness the default setting is not to use the stack.

config RTAI_CLOCK_REALTIME

	default y

	The purpose here is mainly to activate the CLOCK_REALTIME timing 
	support in a few RTAI native services used behind POSIX APIs.
	CLOCK_REALTIME is the default POSIX timing option so it should be
	enabled for a full POSIX support but, if you are either not using 
	POSIX or can work with it using just the CLOCK_MONOTONIC timing, 
	it would be better to avoid enabling this option. It will save you 
	a test on a long long. Not too much of an overhead indeed, but why 
	paying for it if not needed?
	It is defaulted to "yes" just to stay on the safe side.

config RTAI_USE_NEWERR

	help
	Return values for RTAI blocking APIs are a bit sketchy. That 
	is due to a long standing legacy dating back to DOS and 8 bits PCs,
	when saving a few "if"s might have been important. Whatever one's 
	opinion such a legacy has now been likely inherited by many well
	working existing RTAI applications, that might break with a new 
	error return scheme. In any case a better set of error return values 
	might be useful nowadays, so it has been added. With it one will be
	able to correctly infer more detailed reasons for error returns i.e.:
	- invalid requests (RTE_OBJINV),
	- async unblocking (RTE_UNBLKD),
	- timeouts (RTE_TIMOUT),
	- timer overruns (RTE_TMROVRN),
	- deletion of blocking objects (RTE_OBJREM).
	Thus the new scheme has been made configurable to allow RTAI users
	to choose what to do, without forcing any adaption for already 
	existing working applications.
