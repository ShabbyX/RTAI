	  *****************************************************	

Let's recall that scheduling latency calibrations are required only for  
hard timers in oneshot mode. Nothing can be done for periodic hard timers, 
but choosing their ticking frequency.
That said, there are two calibrations to be cared of: hard timers, APIC 
and 8254, shot programming and scheduling latencies, which are to be 
compensated by appropriately anticipating the required timer shots 
programming.

	Calibration of hard timers shot, APIC and 8254, programming
	===========================================================

Such a calibration is fast and hiddenly carried out at each schedule module 
insmoding. So there is no need to care for it.

		      Scheduling latencies calibration
		      ================================

Two different scheduling latency calibrations are required, one for user and 
one for kernel space tasks. In fact there is a sizeable latency difference, 
kernel space latencies being less the those in user space.
The related values can be obtained by configuring RTAI with the RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN option disabled and then running the "calibration_helper", either 
within the installed "calibration" directory or from its installation 
in the RTAI build directory.
The following options, with the related defaults, are available:
-h, --help: prints a synthetic usage of what described here;
-p <period (us)>, --period <period (us)>: assigns the task period, in
	microseconds, to be used for calibrating the scheduling latencies, 
	defaulting to 200 (us) if this option is not set;
-s <spantime (s)>, --spantime <spantime (s)>: the duration, in seconds, of the 
	requested calibration, a 1 (s) default value being assumed;
-t <conv. tol. (ns)>, --tol <conv. tol. (ns)>: the acceptable tolerance, in 
	nanoseconds, within which the latency must stay for a converged 
	calibration, default 100 (ns).
For a prompt reminder of what above simply type "./calibration_helper -h".
It could be useful to remark that the scheduling latencies are somewhat 
dependent on their assigned values. So, as it can be seen from the related 
code, the calibrator iterates the calibration procedure till convergence 
within the above explained convergence tolerance.
It should be noticed also that, for sake of simplicity, the calibrator provides 
different latencies for kernel and user space tasks, while only a single one 
can be set when configuring RTAI. So it is up to the user to choose the right 
compromise between the twos, possibly resorting to the following busy wait 
option explanation for a more precise match.
Moreover if any available latency test is run after calibrating, one could see 
a slightly higher then expected result, especially in user space. That is due 
to the somewhat higher overhead of the latency tests. Nevertheless, generally, 
it should be better to correct not the result of the calibrator.

	Busy wait looping for a sharper on time latency calibration
	===========================================================

The RTAI scheduler has the possibility of assigning scheduling latencies 
slightly in excess of those required and then wait for a sharper matching of 
the scheduling time by busy waiting on the hard timer.
That is achieved by enabling the configuration option RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN.
Since the busy wait is done at the exiting of the scheduler there is still a
completion overhead to be set, to take into account the closure of the whole
return path, i.e. till the exiting of the calling timing function. Therefore,
after enabling RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN, there is the possibility of setting such 
completion values with the options RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY and 
RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY, whose default value is zero. The required 
times can be calibrated by rerunning the calibrator task with RTAI configured 
with:
- the previously found calibrated latency value,
- RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN enabled;
- RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY and RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY set to one.
By reconfiguring RTAI with the thus obtained return delay values it should be 
possible to verify the previously claimed sharper timing. To be sure to engage 
the busy wait, sometimes a user might use such an option in combination with 
a marginally longer than needed latency value. It should be noticed also that 
such a longer than needed value comes by nature for kernel space tasks when 
the calibrated latency is configured with the one of user space tasks.
Since a zero value for RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY and RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY disables the related busy wait, even if RTAI_BUSY_TIME_ALIGN is 
enabled, such an option can be used selectively for kernel and user space 
alone. 
So, as hinted already, one could apply the calibrated user space latency, set 
RTAI_USER_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY to zero and RTAI_KERN_BUSY_ALIGN_RET_DELAY to 
its calibrated value, thus obtaining similar sharp results in both spaces.
On any decently recent machine the busy wait overhead is well sub us, so 
practically negligible in any case.
Finally, it must be remarked that all of what above should be carried out and 
verified on a "quiet" machine. In fact the calibration can be significantly 
affected by any on going relatively heavy processing load. The inevitable 
discrepancies that will be met in any actual application are difficult to cure, 
as verified by quite a few trials with different sorts of adaptive 
latency identification filters, which provided no better result.
So, even if a quiet calibration might not be the achievable best, it is 
likely that it is better to assume that, sometimes, the best can be the enemy 
of the good.
