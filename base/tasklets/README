TASKLETS Tasklets Support Module
================================

The TASKLETS  module you'll find here adds an interesting new feature along
the line, pioneered by RTAI, of a symmetric usage of all its services
inter-intra kernel and user space both for soft and hard real time.
In such a way you have an wide spectrum of development and implementation
options, allowing maximum flexibility with uncompromised performances.
And of course, all LGPL open source.

New services: tasklets and timers
---------------------------------

The new services provided can be useful when you have many tasks, both in
kernel and user space, that must execute in hard real time but do not need
any RTAI scheduler services that could lead to a task block. This constraint
is critical and make sure you fully understand it.

Such tasks are called tasklets and can be of two kinds:

	- A simple tasklets,

	- Timed tasklets (timers).

It must be noted that only timers need to be made available both in user and
kernel space. In fact, simple tasklets in kernel space are nothing but
standard functions that can be directly executed by simply calling them, so
there is no need for any special treatment. However in order to maintain full
usage symmetry, and to continue to allow the possibility of porting
applications from one address space to the other, tasklets functions have
been implemented so they can be used in whatever address space.

Note that the Linux kernel offers similar services. They are not exactly the
same because of the RTAI symmetrical API implementation, but the basic idea
behind them is clearly fairly similar.

It should be clear that for such tasks the standard hard real time tasks
available with RTAI and LXRT schedulers can be a waist of resources and the
execution of simple, possibly timed, functions could often be more than
enough.

Examples of such applications are timed pollings and simple Programmable Logic
Controllers (PLC) like sequences of services. Obviously there are many others
instances that justify the use of tasklets, either simple or timed. In general
such an approach can be a very usefull complement in controlling complex
machines and systems, both for basic and support services.

The implementation
------------------

The TASKLETS implementation of timed tasklets relies on a server support
task that executes the related timer functions, either in oneshot or periodic
mode, on the base of their time deadline and according to their user assigned
priority.

As explained above, plain tasklets are just functions executed from kernel
space. Their execution needs no server and is simply triggered by calling
the user specified tasklet function at due time, either from a kernel task
or interrupt handler in charge of their execution when they are needed.

Once more it is important to recall that only non blocking RTAI scheduler
services can be used in any tasklet function. Services that can block must
absolutely be avoided, as they will deadlock the timers server task, executing
task or interrupt handler, whichever applies, so that no more tasklet functions
will be executed from them.

User and kernel space TASKLETS applications should cooperate and synchronize
by using shared memory.

It has been called TASKLETS because it is a kind of light hard real time
server that can substitute both RTAI and LXRT, if the constraints hinted above
are wholly satisfied. So TASKLETS can be used in kernel and user space,
with any RTAI scheduler.

Its implementation has been very easy to accomplish, as it is nothing but what
its name implies, so that LXRT made all the needed tools already available.

As already done for shared memory and LXRT the function calls for Linux
processes are inlined in the file "tasklets.h". This approach has been
preferred to a library since it is simpler, more effective, the calls are
short and simple so that, even if it is likely that only a few calls are used
for a typical process, they do not add significantly to the size of the
program.


TASKLETS Services
------------------

Services made available by the TASKLETS module (functions, macros and
variable names are self explanatory, see also example test.c):

struct rt_tasklet_struct *rt_tasklet_init(void)

void rt_tasklet_delete(strct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet)

int rt_insert_tasklet(
	struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet,
	void (*handler)(unsigned long),
	unsigned long data,
	unsigned long id,
	int pid
)

void rt_remove_tasklet(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet)

struct rt_tasklet_struct *rt_find_tasklet_by_id(unsigned long id)

void rt_exec_tasklet(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet)

void rt_set_tasklet_priority(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet, int priority)

int rt_set_tasklet_handler(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet, void (*handler)(unsigned long))

#define rt_fast_set_tasklet_handler(tasklet, handler)

void rt_set_tasklet_data(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet, unsigned long data)

#define rt_fast_set_tasklet_data(tasklet, data)

void rt_tasklet_use_fpu(struct rt_tasklet_struct *tasklet, int use_fpu)

struct rt_tasklet_struct *rt_timer_init(void)

void rt_timer_delete(strct rt_tasklet_struct *timer)

int rt_insert_timer(
	struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer,
	int priority,
	RTIME firing_time,
	RTIME period,
	void (*handler)(unsigned long),
	unsigned long data,
	int pid
)

void rt_remove_timer(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer)

void rt_set_timer_priority(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, int priority)

void rt_set_timer_firing_time(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, RTIME firing_time)

void rt_set_timer_period(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, RTIME period)

#define rt_fast_set_timer_period(timer, period)

int rt_set_timer_handler(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, void (*handler)(unsigned long))

#define rt_fast_set_timer_handler(timer, handler)

void rt_set_timer_data(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, unsigned long data)

#define rt_fast_set_timer_data(timer, data)

void rt_timer_use_fpu(struct rt_tasklet_struct *timer, int use_fpu)

The rt_fast... timer related macros can be safely used in kernel space as
alternative to their standard equivalents when the related data and timer
structure address are available.

Remember to always include the header file rtai_timers.h, found in this
directory. It defines struct rt_tasklet_struct and all the tasklet functions
prototypes and macros.

The functions rt_tasklet_init, rt_timer_init, rt_tasklet_delete and
rt_timer_delete are meant to be used in user space only, where the timer
structure must be allocated dynamically in kernel space. They become empty
macros in kernel space, where you must allocate the tasklet structure yourself.


FPU Support and other technicalities
------------------------------------

The timers server task assumes that timer functions never use the Floating
Point Unit (FPU). If that is not the case, the function rt_tasklets_use_fpu
should be used to allow the use of the FPU if it is needed by any timer
function, both in kernel and user space. The same applies to simple tasklets
in user space.

In the kernel, the task, or interrupt handler, executing any tasklet directly
must enable the FPU by appropriately using the fsave and frestore, and
clearing clts (see rtai.h for the related macros).

The timers server runs on a 8096 bytes stack, which should be enough for running
most timers tasklet functions in kernel space. If you need a larger stack either
recompile tasklets.c after setting the macro STACK_SIZE in tasklets.h to what
you want, or simply load the timers server module using "ldmod ./rtai_timers
StackSize=<xxxx>", where <xxxx> is your new stack size.

In user space you run within the memory of the thread associated to the handler
function at tasklet/timer creation, so no problem should arise. Note however
that the thread must lock all of its memory so that it cannot be swapped out.
Generally a tasklet handler should not require more than the stack size Linux
assigns to a process/thread by default. If it is not so pregrow all your
needed memory, see mlockall usage in Linux manuals, by changing the function
support_tasklet found in tasklets.h.

There are also many very useful test cases that demonstrate the use of most
services, both in kernel and user space. See directory tests and related run
files.

RTAI TASKLETS in user space can now work also with LXRT. In facts, as hinted
above their implementation uses a support thread. This because it is thought
that a symmetric use of the TASKLETS APIs along with any user space application
is a must, and all other tried integrations of TASKLETS with LXRT have resulted
to be more cumbersome, huglier and heavier.
To help figuring out what said above note that on a 500 MHz PIII the switching
overhead in user space is around 1 us.
Moreover LXRT has been changed to ease its porting to other architecture, thus
tasklets in user space will be also available to taht architecture, at no added
cost, once the related LXRT port is completed.
It must also be noted that user space tasklest/timers can live in the space of
hard real time LXRT processes/threads. Since hard real time LXRT processes
cannot interact with Linux tasklets/timers, init/delete functions must be called
only when such processes are in soft real time state. It should not be a heavy
constraint unless dynamic init/delete calls are required. In such a case a soft
server thread should be used, a standard way of doing things within hard LXRT.
