		      <*> RTAI_KCOMEDI IN USER SPACE <*>

This porting of KCOMEDI to user space is done using the standard extension
feature of LXRT and makes KCOMEDI symmetrically usable in kernel and user
space within RTAI, in soft/hard real time. To use KCOMEDI in user space you
have just to know how to use it in kernel space. So whatever space you are
going to work in it will be mostly the same.

There are nonetheless a few points forbidding the above statements to be
unconditionally true. The related clashes are resolved with functions
prefixed with "rt_".

One is related to a couple of name returning functions:
"comedi_get_driver_name" and "comedi_get_board_name".

In kernel space the requested name is simply got by returning a pointer to
a directly addressable global namestring, which wont work in user space.
So there is the need of copying the namestring available in kernel space to
user space, therefore the calling convention must be changed. Then the
following two aliases, usable both in kernel and user space, have been made
available:
void *rt_comedi_get_driver_name(unsigned int dev, char *name);
void *rt_comedi_get_board_name(unsigned int dev, char *name);
On success both of them return the address "name", at which the actual name
is copied, NULL otherwise.

The solution of the above problem is simple and, almost, compulsory.
In fact the only real problem to be solved for a symmetric approach to
KCOMEDI in kernel and user space has been the use of a callback function
in user space for which a fairly general usage scheme has been devised.

The callback method made available is based on using a built in callback
function that triggers an rt_task_resume and allows returning back to the
user the important unsigned long mask, made available by the standard KCOMEDI
callback service as its first argument.

The related support comes from using the following function, not needed but
available in kernel space also (in case you'll like it):
int rt_comedi_register_callback(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, unsigned int
mask, int (*callback)(unsigned int, void *), void *task);
- the first 3 arguments are the same as in "comedi_register_callback", while
  "callback" is discarded and "task" is the pointer to an RTAI task that
  waits for asynchronous events to happen. NULL can be used in place of
  "task", if it is the current one, in which case RTAI can care of setting
  it appropriately.

For compatibility reasons the standard COMEDI:
int comedi_register_callback(unsigned int minor, unsigned int subdev,
unsigned int mask, int (*cb)(unsigned int, void *), void *arg);
is also available in user space in the form of a macro that redirects it to
"rt_comedi_register_callback", setting "cb" to NULL while "arg" should be
assigned either the pointer to the task to be used or NULL.
As said there is clearly no need for anything similar in kernel space, as the
original COMEDI function is available directly, but the user space approach,
with its canned solution, might prove viable and easier to use in kernel space
also.

After the COMEDI callback has been initialized a user can synchronize its
application with COMEDI asynchronous events by using any of the following
functions, usable in kernel space also naturally:

long rt_comedi_wait(unsigned int *cbmask);
- this function waits for the callback unconditionally; cbmask is a compulsory
  non NULL pointer to a variable that will receive the callback mask of the
  events that triggered it.

long rt_comedi_wait_if(unsigned int *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but returns immediately
  if no COMEDI event has been signaled yet. Useful for polling COMEDI events,
  through the returned mask, without blocking.

long rt_comedi_wait_until(RTIME until, unsigned int *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but features an absolute
  timeout, given by "until".

unsigned long rt_comedi_wait_timed(RTIME delay, unsigned int *cbmask);
- this function is equivalent to "rt_comedi_wait" but features a relative
  timeout, given by "delay".

- The returned value can be:
- 0 if waiting for a callback succeeded,
- a negative number, in which case its absolute value indicates wait overruns;
- an RTAI error if >= RTE_BASE.

It is likely that the illustrated callback scheme and synchronization is
better exploited by using a thread acting as an asynchronous COMEDI events
manager in hard real time. However it is by no means the only way as the
above wait functions can be used anywhere and rt_comedi_wait_if makes it
possible an easy implementation of a polling scheme.
In fact async wait read functions embed comedi_waits for an easier and more
compact use of async command readings, see below.
Notice that rt_comedi_wait_if is provided to comply with the standard RTAI
synchronizing functions scheme: unconditional, if, until, timed.
An alternative way is provided through the standard KCOMEDI async data polling,
i.e.: comedi_poll.

Once woken up from wait one can call:
long rt_comedi_command_data_read (void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans,
lsampl_t *data);
to get "nchans" channels in "data". Notice that data are read only if "nchans"
elements are available, nothing being done otherwise. Such a condition can
be checked through the returned value, which will be the number of available
read channels data. So a return value less than "nchans" will mean nothing has
been read. The return value can be RTE_OBJINV also, in the case of dev/subdev
being wrong.
It is believed that imposing that either "nchans" data or nothing is available
is the most appropriate real time mechanism, as it is better to let the user
decide what to do in place of waiting on a rescheduling by default. In fact,
after an appropriate wait function is called, missing data might be a error
to care of. If it is not so then, by exploiting the available wait functions,
the user has plenty of opportunities to implement her/his own best policy.
If one notices a bias toward sampling data for digital control systems, versus
pure data acquisition, (s)he is right, absolutely. See below for something
reinforcing such a bias. Despite such an attitude nothing is lost in the case
of pure data acquisition.

A typical code sample could be:

	long mask, avbs;
.
	comedi_register_callback(dev, subdev, COMEDI_CB_EOS, NULL, task);
.
	if (rt_comedi_wait_timed(nano2count(TIMEOUT), &mask) != 0) {
		printf("waiting for async data failed\n");
	}
.
	if (mask & COMEDI_CB_EOS) {
		if ((avbs = rt_comedi_command_data_read(dev, subdev, NCHAN, data)) != NCHAN) {
			printf("only %ld channels data available in place of %d, nothing read\n", avbs, NCHAN);
		}
.
	}
.

Calling an rt_comedi_wait followed by rt_comedi_command_data_read is OK and
let the user do whatever check (s)he needs. Nonetheless, when working in user
space, it has the disadvantage of taking two trips to kernel space. Since what
is mostly required is a successful rt_comedi_wait with a mask containing the
appropriate user expected callback mask the two calls can be unified. Such a
scheme is mostly useful in a digital controller, whereas a single call paces
its action in such a way that at each sampling time one is ready to apply
her/his control law on the available channels samples immediately.

To that end RTAI makes available the following:
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans, lsampl_t *data, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_if(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans, lsampl_t *data, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_until (void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans, lsampl_t *data, RTIME until, long *mask);
long rt_comedi_command_data_wread_timed(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans, lsampl_t *data, RTIME delay, long *mask);
whose arguments are the union of the previous calls, with "mask" containing
the event flags that must be found set in the callback mask returned by COMEDI
callbacks.

The previous code snippet would become:

	long mask, avbs;
.
	comedi_register_callback(dev, subdev, COMEDI_CB_EOS, NULL, task);
.
	mask = COMEDI_CB_EOS;
	if ((avbs = rt_comedi_command_data_wread_timed(dev, subdev, NCHAN, data, nano2count(TIMEOUT), &mask)) != NCHAN) {
		printf("only %ld channels data available in place of %d, or an error occured, nothing read\n", avbs, NCHAN);
	}
.

There are examples in RTAI "showroom" CVS, "user/comedi" that should help
in depicting the use of the above explained extensions.

The async write mate of async data reading is the following:
long rt_comedi_command_data_write(void *dev, unsigned int subdev, long nchans, lsampl_t *data);
arguments and return values being the same of rt_comedi_command_data_read.

Another useful service is:
int rt_comedi_trigger(void *dev, unsigned int subdev);
It is based on an easy set up of a wrapper, using the appropriate comedi_do_insnfor the actual triggering action.

Finally the function:
int rt_comedi_do_insnlist(void *dev, comedi_insnlist *ilist);
has been added, symmetrically in kernel/user space as usual.
It is an exact image of its parent:
int comedi_do_insnlist(void *dev, comedi_insnlist *list);
which is not available in KCOMEDI. That's why we prefixed it with an "rt_".
The simple reason of it being missed in kernel space is because it will add
just the overhead of one call more to obtain something that a user can have
directly by executing repeated "comedi_do_insn" in her/his own way. From user
space instead the overhead of calling "comedi_do_insn" many times could
be much more significant, so it might help in having the possibility of
executing a whole set of instructions in a single shot to kernel space only.

The following macros can be used to avoid remembering the instruction fields:
#define BUILD_AREAD_INSN(insn, subdev, data, nd, chan, arange, aref)
to set up an instruction for analog input;
#define BUILD_AWRITE_INSN(insn, subdev, data, nd, chan, arange, aref)
to set up an instruction for analog output;
#define BUILD_DIO_INSN(insn, subdev, data, nd)
to set up an instruction for digital input/output.

A final warning: all KCOMEDI functions are executed without the comedi_lock
being activated. That's because it adds some, albeit negligible on nowadays
machines, overhead and because in control systems it is rare to have possible
conflicting acquisitions shared among more tasks. If a locked execution is
needed nonetheless, then the user can explicitly configure RTAI to do that,
in which case it will be applied to all services. Being "comedi_lock" and
"comedi_unlock" available to the user anyhow, (s)he is free to apply them
explicitly whenever (s)he has decided to not configure them by default.

         <*> USING RTAI_KCOMEDI FOR DISTRIBUTED DATA ACQUISITION <*>

Distributed data acquisition is obtained by simply using the standard NETRPC
specification, i.e.:

- use just the name of any already available function substituting either
  "rt_..." with "RT_..." or, as for the direct use of COMEDI APIs names.
  prefixing "RT_" in front of them
- add two initial arguments more, i.e. the "node" of and the "port" on the
  remote machine that will execute "RT_..." functions.

For example:
	rt_comedi_do_insnlist(dev, ilist);
becomes:
	RT_comedi_do_insnlist(dev, ilist);
while:
	comedi_do_insn(dev, insn);
becomes:
	RT_comedi_do_insn(dev, insn);
as well.

Naturally the remote node, where the data acquisition hardware is installed,
must have insmoded: all of the modules needed for COMEDI, rtai_netrpc and
rtai_comedi.
There are examples in RTAI "showroom" CVS, "user/comedi" that should help
in depicting the use of the above explained extensions.


		 <*> USING LINUX NATIVE COMEDI DISTRIBUTION <*>

Starting circa linux-2.6.29 a native COMEDI distribution can be found in
Linux own subdirectory "drivers/staging/comedi". So there is no need to
install COMEDI, as found at www.comedi.org, anew anymore. Moreover its use
will likely make one surer to have the latest COMEDI update available.
What follows explains a prompt, likely provisional, way to exploit such a
possibility. One can expect it will stabilize in RTAI hal patches eventually.
At the moment it is supported up to Linux-2.6.34, as the latest Linux releases
have change the basic COMEDI infrastructure a lot and need further work on the
RTAI side.
Notice that it must be applied to a kernel patched for RTAI already.

			      - WHAT TO DO -

In Linux:

1 - cd mylinux/drivers/staging/comedi/, where "mylinux" is the path to the
    elected Linux installation directory. Linux version should be >= 2.6.29
    and <= 2.6.34.
2 - sh /rtaidir/addons/comedi/patchlinuxcomedi, where "rtaidir" is the path
    to the elected RTAI home directory, not the one you'll install it
3 - Go to the elected Linux installation directory, e.g. cd ../../..
4 - Configure Linux to prepare COMEDI modules; they are in the staging part
    of Linux drivers configuration
5 - Make


In RTAI:

1  - Nothing special, simply configure RTAI by setting the COMEDI installation
     directory to "mylinux/drivers/staging/comedi/" and make it as usual
2 -  Basic COMEDI modules (comedi.ko, kcomedilib.ko, comedi_fc.ko) must be i
     installed first, followed by all of the needed RTAI modules, including
     rtai_netrpc.ko if the distributed COMEDI support has to be used,
     rtai_comedi.ko being the very last to install. Then specific drivers
     modules follows.
     Alternative modules installation orders are possible, but the one above
     should be the best. Beware using depmode, because it does not know RTAI
     will use dynamic linking through pointers. So it might work but module
     removal can create problems by cutting still needed links.
