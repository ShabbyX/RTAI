This test shows the use of RTAI distributed processing in user space.
It checks the use of async calls by receiving on a remote mailbox, to which
another task write integer numbers, with an immediate return. A machine lock
is avoided by having both the sender and receiver sleep a bit. Naturally the
receiving task alway misses the sent values. However the sent messages can be
recovered either by a server task or by synchronizing the asynchronous receiver.
The choice depend on the variable SERVER in receiver.c being 1 or 0, assigned
as an arg to the execution command.
See the README in the parent net_rpc directory for an explanation of
asynchronous calls.

To run it on a single machine do:

make
./run [0|1], press ENTER to end it all, otherwise it will end accordingly to
             the macro MAXLOOPS found in sender.c
./rem

To run it on different machines comment out the line executing the process to
be run on onother node, in file run, and set the appropriate dotted decimal
notation IP address of the speaker task on its command line.
