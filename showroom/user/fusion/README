This is a test for RTAI-classic/RTAI-fusion APIs interoperability support.

- It is an initial experimental draft to be completed yet.
- It is for use just with MAGMA.
- It contains originals RTAI-fusion user space "latency" and "switches" 
examples, verbatim copies of fusion originals, plus "latency" with a 
separate "display" process (latwdisp) to test communications through queues.

Be careful! Before using it check the sampling period of the various test 
cases. Extreme cases can be committed now and then. They might be too tight if 
your CPU is below 1 GHz. Moreover not all the compatibility headers have been 
tested yet.

Use:
- make clean
- make
./runl (for RTAI-fusion user space latency)
./runs (for RTAI-fusion user space switch)
./rund (for RTAI-fusion user space latency with a mating display task)
./runi (for RTAI-fusion intr latency monitoring on the 8254 timer)

To have it clearer:
./runl has a native counter part in "fusion/testsuite/latency"
./runs has a native counter part in "fusion/testsuite/switch"
./runi has no equivalent in fusion but you can use it in fusion, as it is, by
       making within your fusion enabled environment, after commentig the
       macro "IS_RTAI" off.
