This test verifies the forcing of a background hard real time task to soft real 
time from a supervisor task. After killing the supervisor the, still running 
in soft real time, background process can be killed by using the kill command.
Just ps the get the pid of rt_task, then do "kill pid", otherwise it will be 
killed by the launch script.
