****** FP EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates the support of floating point operations in
real-time tasks by calculating a sine, that can be seen wave squared on a scope
connected to the parallel port. Since it interrupts a front linux process
(check) that is carrying out a floating point summation it is possible to
verify the appropriate working of fpu support and fp save/restores.

->>>> Be carefull about the macro TICK_PERIOD its value is now set for a
      200 MHz PPro, which can be too much for a less powerfull machine.
      However do not lower it too much otherwise the real time task
      is likely not to interrupt Linux at due time
      and you will see no effect whatsoever.

To run the example type:
make clean
make
./run
Alternatively use your own insmod/rmmod after make.

Then toggling the 'f' key you will put the floating point support on and off
and verify that the calculations carried out in "check" are accordingly right
or wrong. Type ^C to exit.
Note that the above is not true when working with the SMP scheduler as it 
always save/restores the FP environments to be safe against task CPU migration.
Under the MUP scheduler the check can work only if it happens that rt_process
and check are on the same CPU, a purely randomly controlled situation since
you cannot say where Linux is going to run check.
In any case real time FP is safe under RTAI.
