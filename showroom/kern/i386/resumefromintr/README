****** RESUMEFROMINT EXAMPLE ******

This test shows two ways for waking up real time tasks directly from interrupt 
handlers. The task itself can then act, partly or as a whole, as an interrupt 
handler. It is based on using either suspend/resume or semaphore wait/signal.

You can control period and wakeup method through macros in rt_process.h

To run it do:
make clean
make
./run
