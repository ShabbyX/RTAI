****** SOUND EXAMPLE ******

This example only works on i386.

This example is taken from a similar one available in the NMT-RTLinux 
distribution and demonstrates how to pronounce "Linux" correctly! 
Since it is not sure that everyone will be able to make out the words, 
here they are:
"Hello, this is Linus Torvalds. I like to pronounce 'Linux' as 'Linux'"

Unlike the same test from the official NMT-RTLinux release it uses a real time
task and not an interrupt handler to do the job.
A periodic real time task runs at 8 kKhz and at each schedule it tries to get a
sample from RT-FIFO number 0. If successful, it transforms the sample from 8bit
ulaw encoding to 1-bit sample and turns the speaker on or off accordingly.
This takes advantage of the fact that ".au" files are typically sampled
at 8kHz.
The sound quality is pretty low. 1-bit sampling is clearly not enough.

->>>> Be warned about the macro DIVISOR in rt_process.c.
      It divides the tick time to simulate a higher interrupt frequency.
      Use a value appropriate for your PC.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run
