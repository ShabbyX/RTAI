****** SEM_CLOCK EXAMPLE ******

This example demonstrates the use of semaphores in a MUP scheduler.
It is mainly aimed at verifying that such a technique of intercpus 
synchronizations works in a MUP application. Thus we have not cared to revise
the various timings setups used in the same UP/SMP example.

It implements a digital wrist clock in the way detailed in: Andre' Schiper, 
Programmation Concurrent, Presses Polytechnique et Universitaires Romandes, 
Geneve.

To run the example type:

make clean
make
./run

then follow the menu.
