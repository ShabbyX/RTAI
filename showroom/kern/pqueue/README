Here there are four little examples that I used to test the TBX functionality.
All these examples creates one TBX and 7 tasks: task1 sends ordinary messages, 
task4 sends broadcasting messages and task7 sends urgent messages. 
All the other tasks read from the same TBX and print the results on console.


In test 1 (./run1) the messages are fixed strings, while in tests 2 and 3
the message is structured and carries a unique ID number and an identifier
of the source task. The fourth (./runu) is test 2 in user space.

In the head of the file there are some #defines that could be modified, if you
like it, to see what happens.

After MAXCOUNT messages sent, the sending tasks stops.  

These examples generate a lot of printk() on console, but you can read them
from /var/log/messages when the test finishes.
(depending from your /etc/syslog.conf)

Good Luck
